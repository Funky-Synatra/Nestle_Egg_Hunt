# Nestle Egg Hunt - Android Augmented Reality Game

This project is an augmented reality game developed for Android using Java and Android Studio. It was a personal exploration of combining mobile gaming with augmented reality.

## Description

Nestle Egg Hunt is a game where users explore a real-world environment to find virtual eggs using their Android device's camera and augmented reality capabilities.

This project incorporates several aspects of Android development and AR, including:

*   **Augmented Reality:** The game overlays virtual eggs onto the real world, using AR capabilities.
*  **Android UI:** It uses different layouts and activities to manage the game flow.
*  **Multiple screens:** The application uses different screens for different stages of the game.
*  **Basic user interaction**: The game gets user input through clicks on the screen.

This project shows my ability to:

*   Develop a fully functioning AR application.
*   Organize a complex code structure into various activities and different Java classes.
*   Combine UI development with camera manipulation.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url]
    ```
2.  **Open in Android Studio:** Open the project in Android Studio.
3.  **Build and Run:** Build and run the project on an Android device or emulator.

## Important Notes

*   This project requires an Android device that supports AR frameworks (like ARCore).
*   This project was a learning experience that allowed me to explore Augmented Reality development.
*   The project's structure is based on the standard structure of Android Studio projects, with different activities (screens) managing the app flow.
